I am a Software Engineer at Google Aarhus in the Dart compiler and virtual machine team.
I work on the Dart programming language compiler and virtual machine.
Dart is an open source programming language.
You can learn more about Dart on [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/), and you can track my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/).

I received my PhD in the [Programming Languages Research Group](http://eelcovisser.org/wiki/group) at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/) supervised by [Eelco Visser](http://eelcovisser.org/).
I am interested in programming languages in general, and specifically in declarative programming and incremental computing.
My research was focused on declarative programming for (web-based) information systems.
During my PhD I have created IceDust, a domain-specific language for incrementally computing derived values in information systems.

I am an active participant in the research community.
I was the part of the [SPLASH 2015](https://2015.splashcon.org), [2016](https://2016.splashcon.org), and [2017](https://2017.splashcon.org) organizing committee as [Student Volunteer Co-Chair](https://conf.researchr.org/profile/conf/dacoharkes), and volunteered at [SPLASH 2014](https://2014.splashcon.org), [ECOOP 2015](https://2015.ecoop.org/), and [ECOOP 2016](https://2016.ecoop.org/).
I have attended two Dagstuhl Seminars: [Domain-Specific Languages](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=15062) and [Programming Language Techniques for Incremental and Reactive Computing](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=16402), and cooperated in editing the [report](http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/DagRep.5.2.26) of the first.

This page lists my scientific activities (publications, research projects, teaching activities, professional activities, and awards).

## Projects

__IceDust__  
IceDust is a domain-specific language for data modeling and calculating derived values.
The data modeling in IceDust features bidirectional relations and multiplicities.
These multiplicities are part of the type system, avoiding null pointer exceptions.
Derived values in IceDust are specified as expressions (not unlike Excel).
These derived values can be calculated on-demand, incrementally, or eventually.
The IceDust compiler generates code for incremental and eventual derived value updates.
The various calculation strategies can be composed, and the IceDust type system checks for sound composition.

__PixieDust__  
PixieDust is a domain-specific language for building reactive client-side browser applications.
Views are defined as functions in PixieDust, and the PixieDust compiler generates code which maintains views incrementally.
PixieDust is a language extension of IceDust.

__WebLab__  
WebLab is a learning management system with automatic grading of programming assignments based on unit testing.
WebLab contains extensive grading rules for composed assignments: weighted averaging, deadlines (and personal deadline overrides), late penalties, bonus assignments, pass n-out-of-m, etc.
Moreover, WebLab features extensive progress statistics for course managers.
All these calculations are expressed in IceDust.

## Teaching

2017-2018

__Supervising MSc Students__  
Currently I am supervising two master students.
One is working on PixieDust (see above), the other is working on a domain-specific language for terminating computations.
I hope to link to their theses and papers here soon.

2015

__DSLDI Summer School__  
At the [DSLDI summer school of 2015](http://vjovanov.github.io/dsldi-summer-school/) I assisted at the hands on for building languages with [Spoofax](http://spoofax.org).
I helped people getting started, and had to answer various questions about syntax, static semantics and transformations.

2014

__Teaching Assistance__  
I developed the lab for the [Concepts of Programming Languages course](https://weblab.tudelft.nl/ti2606/), based on the [Principles of Programming Languages](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/) by [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/).
The lab consists of writing interpreters in Scala for various languages, increasing in difficulty.
This lab is automatically graded by unit tests.
Since 2014, this lab has been improved upon by others adding unit tests for user test suites and alike.
